## About The Project

FarmConnect is our Android project for CS446/ECE 452.

This is an farm app that has several modes:

Home mode: Work on creating all the data for what is grown on the farm and any other activity that requires a lot of interaction (including typing) and network access. This may include deciding how much product is going to which market etc. 

Farm Mode: No network access and minimal interaction with close to no typing. A farmer or a farm hand is updating the inventory. So voice to text to update the DB locally and sync up with the central DB later when they have network access. 

Market mode: Keeping track of what is sold and how much money they should have made. Again minimal interaction. So preferably voice to text. 

Charity mode: Users post to the app to a common place like Instagram on what is in a community fridge (https://www.facebook.com/CommunityFridgeKW/). The farmer can then find out which fridge near them has limited amount of the produce that they grow so that they can stock that fridge. Image recognition for this
